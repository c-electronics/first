                <p>there are many types of motors but for this case we will talk about two only</p>
                <h3>1. Servo Motors</h3>
                <p>A Servo Motor is a small device that has an output shaft. This shaft can be positioned to specific angular positions by sending the servo a coded sig</p>

                    <p>A DC motor or direct current motor is an electrical machine that transforms electrical energy into mechanical energy by creating a magnetic field that is powered by direct current</p>

                    <strong> Diesel Electric Locomotives </strong>
                    <br>
                    In a diesel electric locomotive, combustion from the diesel engine is converted into rotational energy by the diesel engine, which is coupled with a generator that converts it to electrical energy. The converted electrical energy is fed to DC motors that are coupled with the wheels on the engine.
                    <br><br>

                    <strong>Electric Vehicles</strong>
                    <br>
                    Brushed DC motors are used in electric vehicles for retracting and positioning electrically powered windows. Since brushed motors tend to wear out rapidly, many electric vehicle applications use brushless motors due to their long life span and noiselessness. Brushless DC motors are used for windshield wipers and CD players. All of the recent hybrid electric vehicles depend on brushless DC motors.
                    <br><br>

                    <strong> Cranes</strong>
                    <br>
                    In applications with overhauling loads, it is important for the motor to have the ability to hold a full load at zero speed where mechanical brakes may not be required. In those situations, DC motors are the most cost effective and safest option. A major benefit of their use is their size and weight.
                    <br><br>

                    <strong> Conveyor Systems</strong>
                    <br>
                    Conveyor systems require constant speed and high torque, which makes DC motors an ideal option. As has been found with other applications, DC motors have high torque at start up and even consistent speed. Brushless DC motors are the most commonly used for conveyor applications. They are noiseless and can be easily controlled, a major requirement for conveying systems.
                    <br><br>

                    <strong> Ceiling Fans</strong>
                    <br>
                    Ceiling fans made with DC motors have become extremely popular. They use less power and have a rapid start up torque. The alternating current in a home or office is easily converted to DC power by a transformer, an effect that decreases the amount of power required by the fan. As with other DC motor applications, brushless DC motors are most commonly used in ceiling fans.
                    <br><br>

                    <strong> Pump Drives</strong>
                    <br>
                    DC motors have been the main driving force behind pumps for several decades because of their variable speed control, simple control system, high starting torque, and good transient response. For many years, pumping systems depended on brushed DC motors as their primary source of energy. The development of permanent magnet DC motors and brushless DC motors have offered a more beneficial option for pump system operations.
